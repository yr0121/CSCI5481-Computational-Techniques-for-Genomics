HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
python3 hw4.py Homework_4_seqs.fna on terminal
Code for questions 1,2,3 and bonus are in the hw4.py
variability.txt is the answer for question1 
variability.png is the answer for question2, using a smooth factor 50
variable_region.txt and variable_region.png are the anser for question3
In BONUS folder, 16sRNA,fna, v1.fna and v4.fna is the fasta file for randomly selected 100 seuqences, v1 regions of these seuqences
and v4 regions of these sequences
The phylogenetic are shown in graphs.
The trees were generated by upload fasta sequence files to https://www.ebi.ac.uk, Europan Bioinformatics Institute
to generate Newick files and then paste generated Newick files to Interactive tree of life https://itol.embl.de
In the graph,we can tell that V4 region is more similar to the whole 16srRNA seuqence.
Because V1,V2 and V6 regions containing the greatest intraspecies diversity(Coenye T, Vandamme P (November 2003). "Intragenomic heterogeneity between multiple 16S ribosomal RNA operons in sequenced bacterial genomes". FEMS Microbiology Letters. 228 (1): 45â€“9. doi:10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00717-1. PMID 14612235), I expect that V1 has more variations than V4 and the phylogenetic trees obtained from v4 is more similar to the 16s rRNA phylogenetic tree
